description: thanosquotesredditbot active on r/test which gives thanos quotes when it finds 'thanos quote' written in a comment and replies with '...as all things should be' when finds a comment with phrase 'perfectly balanced'. If bot is not working it is possible that heroku dynos have exhausted or it is currently disabled for making changes. (https://github.com/masterchef2209/thanosquotesredditbot).
